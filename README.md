# Curling Timer X for Rabbit R1

A specialized curling timer application designed for the Rabbit R1 device with a 240x282 display.

## ⚠️ Important Notice - Creation Code Requirement

**Native app installation via QR code requires a Rabbit R1 "creation code" from Rabbit's developer portal.**

If you scan a QR code and see "Not a valid creation code":
- This is expected - the app needs to be registered with Rabbit first
- **Current workaround:** Use web access instead (see Option 2 below)
- **For details:** See [RABBIT_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](RABBIT_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for complete explanation

## 🎯 Quick Start - Installing on Rabbit R1

### Option 1: Install via QR Code (Native App) - ⚠️ Requires Creation Code

**STATUS: NOT YET AVAILABLE** - This method requires an official Rabbit creation code.

⚠️ **Why it doesn't work yet:**
- Rabbit R1 requires apps to be registered in their developer portal
- Apps must receive approval and be assigned a "creation code"
- Regular download URL QR codes show "Not a valid creation code" error
- See [RABBIT_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](RABBIT_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for full details

**We're working on getting official approval. In the meantime, use Option 2 below.**

<details>
<summary>📋 Future Installation Steps (Once We Have Creation Code)</summary>

1. **Generate a QR code** using one of these methods:

   **Using Python (Best):**
   ```bash
   # Install dependency (one time)
   pip install qrcode[pil]
   
   # Generate QR for version 1.0.0 (default)
   python generate-qr.py
   
   # Or specify a different version
   python generate-qr.py --version 1.0.1
   ```

   **Using Online Generator:**
   - Visit [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/)
   - Use the official creation code provided after approval
   - Download the QR code

2. **Scan with Rabbit R1**
   - Open your Rabbit R1 camera or QR scanner
   - Point it at the QR code
   - The app will install automatically

3. **Launch the app** from your Rabbit R1 home screen!

</details>

### Option 2: Web Access (Recommended - Works Now!)

**✅ CURRENTLY WORKING** - Use this method for immediate access!

Access the app through the web browser without waiting for developer approval:

1. **Generate QR for web access:**
   
   **Method 1: Python Script with Rabbit R1 Metadata (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Install dependency (one time)
   pip install qrcode[pil]
   
   # Generate QR code with full Rabbit R1 metadata
   python generate-rabbit-qr.py
   ```
   This generates a QR code containing JSON metadata that includes:
   - App title and description
   - GitHub Pages URL
   - Icon and screenshot URLs
   - Theme color and author info
   
   **Method 2: Web-Based Generator**
   - Open `qr-generator.html` in your browser
   - Select "Rabbit R1 Metadata (JSON)" mode
   - Fill in or modify the app details
   - Click "Generate QR Code"
   - Download or scan directly
   
   **Method 3: Legacy Web-Only URL**
   ```bash
   python generate-qr.py --web-only
   ```

2. **Scan with Rabbit R1** - opens in browser instantly
3. **Bookmark** for quick future access
4. **Full functionality** - Same features as native app!

## 📦 What's the Difference?

| Method | Install Type | Status | Updates | Offline | Performance |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **QR Code Install** | Native package | ⚠️ Not Available Yet* | Manual (rescan QR) | Partially | Better |
| **Web Access** | Browser-based | ✅ Works Now! | Automatic | No | Good |

**Recommendation:** Use **Web Access** for immediate use. We're working on getting the app approved for native installation.

\* Requires official Rabbit creation code - see [RABBIT_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](RABBIT_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)

## 🚀 Features

- **Timer**: Precision timing from hog line to back line
- **Ice Speed Tracking**: Adjust and record ice speed conditions (1-10 scale)
- **Sweeping Recommendations**: Real-time guidance based on stone position and ice speed
- **Shot History**: Track your last shots with detailed metrics
- **Settings**: View ice speed history and average times
- **PTT Voice Assistant Prevention**: Uses multiple strategies to prevent accidental voice assistant activation when using the PTT button for timer control (see [VOICE_ASSISTANT_PREVENTION_GUIDE.md](VOICE_ASSISTANT_PREVENTION_GUIDE.md) for technical details)

## 🎮 Device Controls

The app integrates with Rabbit R1's native controls:
- **Side Button (Hold)**: Start/stop timer (voice assistant disabled while app is active)
- **Scroll Wheel**: Adjust ice speed
- **Screen Tap**: Record shot and reset

**Note**: The app implements multiple strategies to prevent the PTT (Push-to-Talk) button from triggering the voice assistant when pressed. This includes event prevention, multi-channel native notifications, and manifest-level configuration. See [VOICE_ASSISTANT_PREVENTION_GUIDE.md](VOICE_ASSISTANT_PREVENTION_GUIDE.md) for complete technical details and testing instructions.

See `apps/app/src/lib/device-controls.md` for detailed API documentation.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Creation Code Issues

**"Not a valid creation code" error?**
- This is expected - Rabbit R1 requires official creation codes from their developer portal
- Apps must be registered and approved by Rabbit before native installation works
- **Solution:** Use web access instead - it works immediately!
  ```bash
  python generate-qr.py --web-only
  ```
- For full explanation, see [RABBIT_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](RABBIT_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)

### Installation Issues

**QR code scanning but nothing happens?**
- If trying native installation: See "Creation Code Issues" above
- If using web access: Ensure you're using the correct GitHub Pages URL
- Try the web access method as a fallback: `python generate-qr.py --web-only`

**"File not found" or 404 error?**
- For native install: Not applicable yet (needs creation code)
- For web access: Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment
- Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/RiveCo/curlingTimerX/releases)
- Clear browser cache and try again

**Download starts but won't install?**
- Native installation requires an official Rabbit creation code
- The .rabbit package format is correct, but Rabbit's platform requires approval
- **Current solution:** Use web access method instead
- See [RABBIT_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](RABBIT_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for developer portal information

### Web Access Issues

**Can't access GitHub Pages URL?**
- Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment for changes to propagate
- Check the Actions tab to verify deployment succeeded
- Try accessing in incognito/private mode
- Clear your browser cache

**App loads but doesn't work properly?**
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled

### QR Code Issues

**QR code won't scan?**
- Ensure the QR code is large enough (at least 200x200 pixels)
- Check for good contrast (black on white background)
- Try scanning in better lighting conditions
- Hold the R1 steady and at appropriate distance

**Generated wrong QR code?**
```bash
# For Rabbit R1 with full metadata (Recommended)
python generate-rabbit-qr.py

# For web access only (legacy)
python generate-qr.py --web-only

# For app installation (requires creation code)
python generate-qr.py --version 1.0.0

# Custom URL
python generate-qr.py --url "https://your-custom-url.com"
```

**Need to customize the QR code metadata?**
- Edit `rabbit-metadata.json` to change app details
- Or use `qr-generator.html` for a visual editor
- Run `python generate-rabbit-qr.py` to regenerate

### Build/Development Issues

**Build fails?**
```bash
# Clean install dependencies
cd apps/app
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

**Packaging script fails?**
```bash
# Ensure build exists first
cd apps/app && npm run build && cd ../..

# Then package
./package-rabbit.sh 1.0.0
```

**GitHub Actions workflow fails?**
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" as source
- Verify Node.js 20 is compatible
- Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
